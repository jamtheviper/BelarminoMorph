        <h2>Introduction to Windows Form IDE</h2>
        </br>
        <h3>Windows Forms is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) class library which is bundled in .Net
            Framework. Its main purpose is to provide an easier interface to develop the applications for desktop,
            tablet, PCs. It is also termed as the WinForms. The applications which are developed by using Windows
            Forms or WinForms are known as the Windows Forms Applications that runs on the desktop computer.
            WinForms can be used only to develop the Windows Forms Applications not web applications.
            WinForms applications can contain the different type of controls like labels, list boxes, tooltip etc. VB.Net provides a huge variety of controls that help you to create rich user interface. Functionalities
            of all these controls are defined in the respective control classes. The control classes are defined in
            the System.Windows.Forms namespace.</h3>

        <h4>Methods and Introduction to Procedures</h4>
        </br>

        <h5>In a procedural programming language the basic unit of code is the procedure. A procedure is a set of instructions that compute some value or take some action (such as printing or reading a character value). The definition of a procedure is very similar to the definition of an algorithm. A procedure is a set of rules to follow which, if they conclude, produce some result. An algorithm is also such a sequence, but an algorithm is guaranteed to terminate whereas a procedure offers no such guarantee.</h5>

    <h4>Arithmetic Operations and Expressions</h4>
    </br>

    <h5>Arithmetic operators are used in an arithmetic expression to tell the computer how this expression/s involving numeric data is to be evaluated into a single value. An arithmetic expression in a program consists of one or more numeric data and arithmetic operators.</h5>
